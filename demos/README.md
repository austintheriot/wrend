# Demos

These demos are created for the purpose of testing the `wrend` library, but also for me to explore new ideas with Rust / WebGL and visual creative coding.

## About 

Each demo in this folder is a self-contained micro app that is rendered from the `entry` crate when the entire demo app is built together.
