# Demos

These demos are more extensive than the `examples` directory, intended for showcasing how `wrend` can be used in more extensive applications and for exploring new ideas with Rust / WebGL.

## About

Each demo in this folder is a self-contained micro app that is rendered from the `entry` crate when the entire demo app is built together.

## Future Demo Ideas

- Real-time video filters
- Ray marcher
- 3D Game
