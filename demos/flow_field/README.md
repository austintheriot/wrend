# Flow Field

## Ideas

### 2D
- Gentle water flowing
- Sand dunes
- Play with speed / movement damping
- Make the perlin noise move slower / faster
- Add animated streaks (render to texture and average with previous frame(s))

### 3D
- Add camera / ability to move around
- Make particles volumetric and/or bigger/smaller depending on closeness
