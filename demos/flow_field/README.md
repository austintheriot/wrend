# Flow Field

## Ideas

### 2D
- Gentle water flowing
- Sand dunes
- Play with speed / movement damping
- Make the perlin noise move slower / faster
- Add animated streaks (render to texture and average with previous frame(s))
- Try pausing Perlin noise to see how it affects the patterns
- Stop clearing canvas and lower opacity of the particles
- Try coloring surroundings (i.e. non-particle areas) based on color of Perlin noise values
- Bigger / smaller Perlin noise shapes
- Color particles based on their location / speed (?)
- Use as the STARTING point for some other designs

### 3D
- Add camera / ability to move around
- Make particles volumetric and/or bigger/smaller depending on closeness
